This directory contains patches for various Nvidia scripts normally found in
Linux_for_Tegra/

They mostly remove root requirements and exchange proot for chroot so root is 
not required to build images.

The original scripts are licensed to Nvidia (see LICENSE.originals). The patches
should likewise be considered under the same license.
